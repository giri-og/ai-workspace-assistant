Next Steps: Deploy to Vercel
Go to Vercel and sign in with your GitHub account.
Click “New Project” and import your ai-workspace-assistant repo.
For the frontend, set the root directory to client.
(Optional) For the backend, deploy separately (recommended: Render.com for Node.js/Express).
Set any required environment variables (e.g., REACT_APP_API_URL for frontend, OPENAI_API_KEY for backend).
Click Deploy.
Tip:

If you want your React app to talk to your backend, make sure API URLs in your frontend point to your deployed backend, not localhost.
You can update this in your React code using an environment variable (e.g., REACT_APP_API_URL).
